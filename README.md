# Data Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analyst portfolio! This repository contains three data analysis projects from different industries: Lego, Pharma, and Fintech. Each project includes data acquisition, data preparation, data analytics, and data visualization using Python.

## Project 1: Lego Sales Analysis

### Overview
In this project, I analyzed sales data from a Lego store to provide insights into product popularity and customer behavior.

#### Conclusions
I found that certain product categories had higher sales, indicating customer preferences. Additionally, sales were influenced by seasonal trends, with spikes around holidays.

#### Challenges
- Dealing with missing data in the dataset required careful consideration of data imputation techniques.
- Combining data from multiple sources with different structures posed integration challenges.

#### Cool Techniques
- Utilized hierarchical clustering to identify customer segments based on their purchasing behavior.
- Implemented time series decomposition to uncover underlying patterns in sales data.

## Project 2: Pharma Drug Analysis

### Overview
In this project, I analyzed pharmaceutical drug data to understand the efficacy and safety of various drugs.

#### Conclusions
I discovered that certain drugs exhibited higher success rates in treating specific medical conditions. Adverse reactions were also correlated with certain drug combinations.

#### Challenges
- Handling incomplete and unstructured data required thorough data cleaning and normalization.
- Dealing with imbalanced datasets in adverse reactions analysis needed careful consideration of sampling techniques.

#### Cool Techniques
- Applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract insights from text-based drug reviews.
- Employed classification algorithms to predict adverse reactions based on drug attributes.

## Project 3: Fintech Credit Scoring

### Overview
In this project, I worked on a credit scoring analysis for a fintech company, aiming to predict the creditworthiness of applicants.

#### Conclusions
By using a combination of applicant data and financial indicators, I developed a credit scoring model that effectively predicted the likelihood of default.

#### Challenges
- Dealing with imbalanced data distribution required implementing techniques like SMOTE for better model performance.
- Feature engineering to create relevant indicators for credit risk assessment was a critical step.

#### Cool Techniques
- Employed feature scaling and transformation to handle numerical and categorical data effectively.
- Utilized ensemble techniques like Random Forest to improve the predictive power of the credit scoring model.

## Tools Used
- Python for data acquisition, preparation, analytics, and visualization.
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn.
